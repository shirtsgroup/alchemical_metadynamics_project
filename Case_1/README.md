Case 1: Hydration of an argon atom
==================================
- `Prep`: A folder containing input files for preparing the system with a standard protocol composed of steps including system solvation, energy minimization, NVT and NPT equilibration and finally a short standard MD simulation in the NPT ensemble. 

- `Test_1`: A folder containing simulation inputs for running 3 replicates of expanded ensemble and 1D alchemical metadynamics for the system. Some analysis results are also included.
