alchemical_MetaD
================

## Description
This is a repository for maintaining the simulation files and analysis codes for the alchemical metadynamics project, which proposed adding alchemical variables to metadynamics to enhance sampling for free energy calculations. The method is demonstrated with three different test systems/alchemical processes, including decoupling an argon atom or a 4-site model from water, and the methylation of a nucleoside both in the isolated form and in a duplex. Note that
- To keep the repository lightweight, we don't store simulation output files, including `*.edr`, `*.log`, `*.trr`, `*.xtc`, `*cpt`, `*COLVAR*`, `*HILLS*` and most of the `*xvg` files. We do keep some `*txt` files storing analysis results and some analysis outputs in the `*png` format. 
- Some preliminary tests of the project were stored in the archived project repository [MetaD_EXE_TestSys](https://github.com/wehs7661/MetaD_EXE_TestSys).
