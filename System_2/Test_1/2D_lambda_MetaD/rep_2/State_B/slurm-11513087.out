Reading file sys2.tpr, VERSION 2021.4-plumed-2.8.0 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 40, rlist from 0.9 to 0.999

Using 64 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 2 OpenMP threads per MPI process

starting mdrun 'Generic title in water'
100000000 steps, 200000.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: PME load balancing increased the non-bonded workload by more than 50%.
      For better performance, use (more) PME ranks (mdrun -npme),
      or if you are beyond the scaling limit, use fewer total ranks (or nodes).


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was turned on during the run due to measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 5.2%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 75%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 3.9%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 2 % Y 2 % Z 2 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.073
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 2.2 %
