\section{Comparison of methylation free energy calculations with dynamic and static biases}
% We should include the lengths of the simulations using the dynamic bias and mention the adopted truncation fraction, average fraction, number of blocks in block bootstrapping, number of iteration for each data point. We should also explain the meaning of the 4th point by explicitly stating what values the 4th point took the difference from. (Like what is done in the section of free energy calculations for the last system in the main text.) 
As a supplementary information, we show the free energy calculations with dynamic bias for the nucleotide and duplex systems. These calculations are done in comparison with the free energy differences computed with static bias presented in the main text. Specifically, simulations at dynamic bias were elongated up to 160 ns. For analysis, the first 60 ns were discarded, and the bias averaged over the remaining 100 ns was used to compute weights. Different numbers of blocks ranging 2 to 1000 were used to construct histograms in block boostrapping (200 iterations) and the largest uncertainty is reported. 

The figure below shows that with dynamic bias, the free energy estimates are more precise (lower statistical errors). This is mostly likely  attributable to the fact that the sampling in the CV space is more diffusive in these systems with dynamically updated weights. However, free energy estimates computed with dynamic bias are less accurate, i.e. the results differ more in alchemical metadynamics than in the case of Hamiltonian replica exchange (HREX). This is probably caused by the dynamic bias adding some small amount of history-dependent blurring. 

To further demonstrate the lower accuracy of the dynamic bias computation, the free energy difference ($\Delta G^{\text{dup, A}}_{syn/anti}$) between the two conformations of adenosine shown in Figure 3A in the main text is calculated. In the work by Piomponi et al.,~\cite{piomponi2022molecular} this value was assumed to be 0 because of the symmetry of the hydrogen atoms H61 and H62. Also, HREX used in the previous work does not have the access to the free energy landscape along the biased torsion, so the relative error is not given for the HREX case. In alchemical metadynamics, $\Delta G^{\text{dup, A}}_{anti/syn}$ was calculated as follows: 
\begin{equation}
    \Delta G^{\text{dup, A}}_{syn/anti}=-\frac{1}{\beta} \ln \left( \frac{\sum_{i \in anti} e^{\beta V^{\text{dup}}_{\text{tot}}(\eta_i, \lambda=0) }}{\sum_{i \in syn} e^{\beta V^{\text{dup}}_{\text{tot}}(\eta_i, \lambda=0)}}\right )
\end{equation} 

For most systems, the general understanding is that using plain metadynamics instead of doing the two-step procedure is better~\cite{bussi2020using}. It is likely the result is system dependent and related to the fact that even without a dynamic bias we can see many of transitions, thus a reasonable statistical error. In this way, we are clearly in the regime where fewer transitions at equilibrium are a safer estimate.

We refer the structures have a torsional angle of $\pm$180$^{\circ}$ and 0$^{\circ}$ as State A (trans isomer) and State B (cis isomer). The torsional free energy barrier starting from either state is around 48.56 kT, which might not be exact since the analysis was done on a very short (5 ns) simulation solely for generating configurations at both states. (B) The histogram of the sampled torsional angle in the torsional metadynamics. As can be seen, the system was able to sample both states frequently during the short simulation.}

In this case, the system becomes diffusive on  N1-C6-N6-C10 after a few ns (C)  N1-C6-N6-C10 vs  N1-C6-N6-H62 when  N1-C6-N6-C10 is used as CV (D) N1-C6-N6-C10 vs  N1-C6-N6-H62 when the averaged torsion is used as CV. The three torsions mentioned here are coupled by an improper torsion that maintains the group C10, N6, H61, and H62 planar. The results shown here demonstrate that the improper torsion is not sufficiently stiff to maintain the consistency between the three torsions when enforcing the barrier crossing. As a consequence, the single N1-C6-N6-C10 torsion is not an optimal CV to allow a proper sampling of the torsional space.}
